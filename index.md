## **Bio**:

I am currently a Computer Science (B.S.) major at the *University of California - San Diego (UCSD)*, with interests in seeing how the physical and virtual worlds interact.

In addition, when I am not coding or tackling algorithmic challenges, I may be found with my camera ([see below](#photography-assignment-photo-sample)), tutoring students in math, science, and coding, or eagerly reading of and experimenting with the next technology I wish to use.

**Inspirations**:

 - *"Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak. Courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen." - Winston Churchill*

 - `do { try() && tryAgain()} while(true);`

     - [x] program crash;
     - [ ] brilliance restored;
     - [x] success;
     - [x] from twilight to bed, to learning we are led.
